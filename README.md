# PoisonPlantsModel

An Android and tensorflow App to recognize poisonouse or deadly plants in the wild.

## Installing
The release APK is under androidApp/PoisonPlant/app/release just download the apk
to your device and install the app.

## Usage
The app is mostly self explanatory 

The app has a couple of menus to take photos or upload photos already on your device
when a plant image is recognized as a plant from the internal database it takes
the user to a page that describes the "bad stuff about the plant".

## Notes
This only runs on Android. 

If anyone wants to contribute images, help test the app and give feedback, or help with
development that would be helpful!
